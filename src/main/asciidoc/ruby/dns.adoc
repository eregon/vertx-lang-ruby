== DNS client

Often you will find yourself in situations where you need to obtain DNS informations in an asynchronous fashion.

Unfortunally this is not possible with the API that is shipped with the Java Virtual Machine itself. Because of
this Vert.x offers it's own API for DNS resolution which is fully asynchronous.

To obtain a DnsClient instance you will create a new via the Vertx instance.

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "10.0.0.1")

----

You can also create the client with options and configure the query timeout.

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client({
  'port' => 53,
  'host' => "10.0.0.1",
  'queryTimeout' => 10000
})

----

Creating the client with no arguments or omitting the server address will use the address of the server used internally
for non blocking address resolution.

[source,ruby]
----
client1 = vertx.create_dns_client()

# Just the same but with a different query timeout
client2 = vertx.create_dns_client({
  'queryTimeout' => 10000
})

----

=== lookup

Try to lookup the A (ipv4) or AAAA (ipv6) record for a given name. The first which is returned will be used,
so it behaves the same way as you may be used from when using "nslookup" on your operation system.

To lookup the A / AAAA record for "vertx.io" you would typically use it like:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.lookup("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    puts ar
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== lookup4

Try to lookup the A (ipv4) record for a given name. The first which is returned will be used, so it behaves
the same way as you may be used from when using "nslookup" on your operation system.

To lookup the A record for "vertx.io" you would typically use it like:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.lookup4("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    puts ar
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== lookup6

Try to lookup the AAAA (ipv6) record for a given name. The first which is returned will be used, so it behaves the
same way as you may be used from when using "nslookup" on your operation system.

To lookup the A record for "vertx.io" you would typically use it like:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.lookup6("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    puts ar
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveA

Try to resolve all A (ipv4) records for a given name. This is quite similar to using "dig" on unix like operation
systems.

To lookup all the A records for "vertx.io" you would typically do:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_a("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveAAAA

Try to resolve all AAAA (ipv6) records for a given name. This is quite similar to using "dig" on unix like
operation systems.

To lookup all the AAAAA records for "vertx.io" you would typically do:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_aaaa("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveCNAME

Try to resolve all CNAME records for a given name. This is quite similar to using "dig" on unix like operation
systems.

To lookup all the CNAME records for "vertx.io" you would typically do:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_cname("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveMX

Try to resolve all MX records for a given name. The MX records are used to define which Mail-Server accepts
emails for a given domain.

To lookup all the MX records for "vertx.io" you would typically do:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_mx("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

Be aware that the List will contain the `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/MxRecord.html[MxRecord]` sorted by the priority of them, which
means MX records with smaller priority coming first in the List.

The `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/MxRecord.html[MxRecord]` allows you to access the priority and the name of the MX record by offer methods for it like:

[source,ruby]
----
record.priority()
record.name()

----

=== resolveTXT

Try to resolve all TXT records for a given name. TXT records are often used to define extra informations for a domain.

To resolve all the TXT records for "vertx.io" you could use something along these lines:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_txt("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveNS

Try to resolve all NS records for a given name. The NS records specify which DNS Server hosts the DNS informations
for a given domain.

To resolve all the NS records for "vertx.io" you could use something along these lines:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_ns("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== resolveSRV

Try to resolve all SRV records for a given name. The SRV records are used to define extra informations like port and
hostname of services. Some protocols need this extra informations.

To lookup all the SRV records for "vertx.io" you would typically do:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_srv("vertx.io") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    records = ar
    records.each do |record|
      puts record
    end
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

Be aware that the List will contain the SrvRecords sorted by the priority of them, which means SrvRecords
with smaller priority coming first in the List.

The `link:../../yardoc/Vertx/SrvRecord.html[SrvRecord]` allows you to access all informations contained in the SRV record itself:

[source,ruby]
----
record.priority()
record.name()
record.weight()
record.port()
record.protocol()
record.service()
record.target()

----

Please refer to the API docs for the exact details.

=== resolvePTR

Try to resolve the PTR record for a given name. The PTR record maps an ipaddress to a name.

To resolve the PTR record for the ipaddress 10.0.0.1 you would use the PTR notion of "1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa"

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.resolve_ptr("1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    record = ar
    puts record
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}

----

=== reverseLookup

Try to do a reverse lookup for an ipaddress. This is basically the same as resolve a PTR record, but allows you to
just pass in the ipaddress and not a valid PTR query string.

To do a reverse lookup for the ipaddress 10.0.0.1 do something similar like this:

[source,ruby]
----
client = vertx.create_dns_client(53, "9.9.9.9")
client.reverse_lookup("10.0.0.1") { |ar_err,ar|
  if (ar_err == nil)
    record = ar
    puts record
  else
    puts "Failed to resolve entry#{ar_err}"
  end
}
